 Bob
=======================

Bob_ is a free signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally developed by
the Biometrics Security and Privacy Group, the Biosignal Processing Group, and the
Research and Development Engineers at `Idiap`_ Research Institute, Switzerland.

The toolbox is written in a mix of `Python`_ and `C++`_ and is designed to be both
efficient and reduce development time. It is composed of a reasonably large number of
:ref:`independent packages <bob.packages>` that implement tools for image, audio &
video processing, machine learning & pattern recognition, and a lot more task specific
packages.
